Hello, and welcome to my blog. There's a bit more information about me in the "About" tab at the top. 

I'm aiming to write regular articles about administrative data research, generally in the area of health and social care, but also placing that in a broader context of social sciences. 

I hope you enjoy what you read, and please get in touch via twitter (again link at the top) if you want to discuss anything further. 

David
